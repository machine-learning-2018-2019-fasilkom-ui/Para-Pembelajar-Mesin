<JUDUL> Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software </JUDUL>
<SINOPSIS> Capturing a wealth of experience about the design of object-oriented software, four top-notch designers present a catalog of simple and succinct solutions to commonly occurring design problems. Previously undocumented, these 23 patterns allow designers to create more flexible, elegant, and ultimately reusable designs without having to rediscover the design solutions themselves. The authors begin by describing what patterns are and how they can help you design object-oriented software. They then go on to systematically name, explain, evaluate, and catalog recurring designs in object-oriented systems. With Design Patterns as your guide, you will learn how these important patterns fit into the software development process, and how you can leverage them to solve your own design problems most efficiently. Each pattern describes the circumstances in which it is applicable, when it can be applied in view of other design constraints, and the consequences and trade-offs of using the pattern within a larger design. All patterns are compiled from real systems and are based on real-world examples. Each pattern also includes code that demonstrates how it may be implemented in object-oriented programming languages like C++ or Smalltalk. </SINOPSIS>

<JUDUL> Biology </JUDUL>
<SINOPSIS> Neil Campbell and Jane Reece's BIOLOGY remains unsurpassed as the most successful majors biology textbook in the world. This text has invited more than 4 million students into the study of this dynamic and essential discipline.The authors have restructured each chapter around a conceptual framework of five or six big ideas. An Overview draws students in and sets the stage for the rest of the chapter, each numbered Concept Head announces the beginning of a new concept, and Concept Check questions at the end of each chapter encourage students to assess their mastery of a given concept. New Inquiry Figures focus students on the experimental process, and new Research Method Figures illustrate important techniques in biology. Each chapter ends with a Scientific Inquiry Question that asks students to apply scientific investigation skills to the content of the chapter. </SINOPSIS>

<JUDUL> Heat Transfer </JUDUL>
<SINOPSIS> The single objective of this book is to provide engineers with the capability, tools, and confidence to solve real-world heat transfer problems. It includes many advanced topics, such as Bessel functions, Laplace transforms, separation of variables, Duhamel's theorem, and complex combination, as well as high order explicit and implicit numerical integration algorithms. These analytical and numerical solution methods are applied to topics not considered in most textbooks. Examples are heat exchangers involving fluids with varying specific heats or phase changes; heat exchangers in which axial conduction is a concern; and regenerators. To improve readability, derivations of important results are presented completely, without skipping steps, which reduces student frustration and improves retention. The examples in the book are ubiquitous, not trivial "textbook" exercises. They are rather complex and timely real-world problems that are inherently interesting. This textbook integrates the computational software packages Maple, MATLAB, FEHT, and Engineering Equation Solver (EES) directly with the heat transfer material. </SINOPSIS>

<JUDUL> Shigley's Mechanical Engineering Design (McGraw-Hill Series in Mechanical Engineering) </JUDUL>
<SINOPSIS> Shigley's Mechanical Engineering Design is intended for students beginning the study of mechanical engineering design. Students will find that the text inherently directs them into familiarity with both the basics of design decisions and the standards of industrial components. It combines the straightforward focus on fundamentals that instructors have come to expect, with a modern emphasis on design and new applications. The tenth edition maintains the well-designed approach that has made this book the standard in machine design for nearly 50 years. </SINOPSIS>

<JUDUL> Foundations of Nuclear and Particle Physics </JUDUL>
<SINOPSIS> This textbook brings together nuclear and particle physics, presenting a balanced overview of both fields as well as the interplay between the two. The theoretical as well as the experimental foundations are covered, providing students with a deep understanding of the subject. In-chapter exercises ranging from basic experimental to sophisticated theoretical questions provide an important tool for students to solidify their knowledge. Suitable for upper undergraduate courses in nuclear and particle physics as well as more advanced courses, the book includes road maps guiding instructors on tailoring the content to their course. Online resources including color figures, tables, and a solutions manual complete the teaching package. This textbook will be essential for students preparing for further study or a career in the field who require a solid grasp of both nuclear and particle physics. </SINOPSIS>

<JUDUL> A People's History of the World: From the Stone Age to the New Millennium </JUDUL>
<SINOPSIS> From the earliest human societies to the Holy Roman Empire, from the Middle Ages to the Enlightenment, from the Industrial Revolution to the end of the twentieth century, Chris Harman provides a brilliant and comprehensive history of the human race. Eschewing the standard accounts of “Great Men,” of dates and kings, Harman offers a groundbreaking counter-history, a breathtaking sweep across the centuries in the tradition of “history from below.” In a fiery narrative, he shows how ordinary men and women were involved in creating and changing society and how conflict between classes was often at the core of these developments. While many scholars see the victory of capitalism as now safely secured, Harman explains the rise and fall of societies and civilizations throughout the ages and demonstrates that history moves ever onward in every age. This magisterial study is essential reading for anyone interested in how society has changed and developed and the possibilities for further radical progress. </SINOPSIS>

<JUDUL> Fluid Mechanics Fundamentals and Applications </JUDUL>
<SINOPSIS> Cengel and Cimbala's Fluid Mechanics Fundamentals and Applications, communicates directly with tomorrow's engineers in a simple yet precise manner. The text covers the basic principles and equations of fluid mechanics in the context of numerous and diverse real-world engineering examples. The text helps students develop an intuitive understanding of fluid mechanics by emphasizing the physics, using figures, numerous photographs and visual aids to reinforce the physics. The highly visual approach enhances the learning of Fluid mechanics by students. This text distinguishes itself from others by the way the material is presented - in a progressive order from simple to more difficult, building each chapter upon foundations laid down in previous chapters. In this way, even the traditionally challenging aspects of fluid mechanics can be learned effectively. </SINOPSIS>

<JUDUL> Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning (Information Science and Statistics) </JUDUL>
<SINOPSIS> This is the first textbook on pattern recognition to present the Bayesian viewpoint. The book presents approximate inference algorithms that permit fast approximate answers in situations where exact answers are not feasible. It uses graphical models to describe probability distributions when no other books apply graphical models to machine learning. No previous knowledge of pattern recognition or machine learning concepts is assumed. Familiarity with multivariate calculus and basic linear algebra is required, and some experience in the use of probabilities would be helpful though not essential as the book includes a self-contained introduction to basic probability theory. </SINOPSIS>
